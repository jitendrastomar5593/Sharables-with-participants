	• Azure CNI
	• AWS VPC CNI
	• GKE VPC Network Peering
	• CNI-Genie
	• Weave Net Multicast
	• kube-bridge


Flannel:
	• Flannel is a simple and lightweight network fabric designed for Kubernetes.
	• It uses the VXLAN overlay network to create a virtual network connecting nodes.
	• Flannel assigns a subnet to each node and ensures that containers on different nodes can communicate with each other.
	• It is easy to set up and widely used in Kubernetes clusters.
	• Suitable for small to medium-sized clusters and provides good performance.
	• GitHub repository: coreos/flannel

Calico:
	• Calico provides network policy enforcement and secure network connectivity for Kubernetes.
	• It uses standard Linux networking components such as BGP routing and iptables to enforce policies and route traffic.
	• Calico can scale to large clusters and supports advanced networking features.
	• It offers network segmentation and isolation, allowing fine-grained control over network traffic between pods and nodes.
	• Suitable for large-scale deployments and environments that require strong network policies.
	• GitHub repository: projectcalico/calico

Weave:
	• Weave provides a simple and flexible network overlay for Kubernetes.
	• It creates a virtual network that connects pods across different hosts using VXLAN or UDP tunnels.
	• Weave enables direct communication between pods without requiring external load balancers.
	• It includes features like network encryption, DNS-based service discovery, and network segmentation.
	• Suitable for small to medium-sized clusters and environments that require easy setup and flexible networking options.
	• GitHub repository: weaveworks/weave

Cilium:
	• Cilium is a networking and security plugin that provides API-aware network and security enforcement for Kubernetes.
	• It uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to enable fast packet processing and fine-grained control.
	• Cilium offers observability, load balancing, network security policies, and transparent encryption.
	• It is suitable for large-scale deployments and environments that require advanced security and observability features.
	• GitHub repository: cilium/cilium

Antrea:
	• Antrea is a Kubernetes networking plugin specifically designed for Kubernetes native networking.
	• It uses Open vSwitch (OVS) as the data plane and supports Kubernetes Network Policy enforcement.
	• Antrea leverages the OVS hardware acceleration capabilities for improved performance.
	• It provides basic networking and security features while focusing on simplicity and ease of use.
	• Suitable for small to medium-sized clusters and environments that prioritize simplicity and Kubernetes-native features.
	• GitHub repository: vmware-tanzu/antrea
