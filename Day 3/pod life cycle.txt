this happens on MASTER node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. pod created --> pending state --> depolyment is accepted, but hasn't scheduled on any node.
2. "schedular" will check for the resources (CPU, Mem) & then it will be pushed to that worker node.

this happens on WORKER node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. pod status changes from PENDING to CREATING
4. in this state, image will be checked (locally), else it will download the image from DockerHub.
5. once, image is pulled, container state changed from CREATING to RUNNING.
6. if it fails due to any reason, the state will change to FAILED.
7. RUNNING state means that the application is deployed.
8. if the container fails, K8 will restart the container/pod.
9. if the crash happens freq, then state changes to "CRASHLOOP BACK OFF"
10. then pod tries to HEAL itself. if success -> OK, else - TS manually.
