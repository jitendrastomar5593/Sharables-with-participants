Master Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1. API Server
		- allows users & other components to interact with the cluster.
		- like a gate keeper.
		- API Server will validate the config creds.
		- if the validation is correct, then it saves the data in the ETCD store.
	2. ETCD
		- its like a database (key:value pair)
		- its a persistent db.
		- it stores 
			- cluster configuration
			- Application configuration
			- Secrets & sensitive data
				- password, certificates
	3. Controller Manager
		- it is called as "contoller of controllers".
		- it manages:
			- Node controller
			- Replication controller
			- Endpoints contoller
			- Service & token controller
		- it manages/ensures that the specific no. of container(s)  are running as described in the config (YAML) file.
	4. Scheduler
		- it is responsible for scheduling (placing) a container into a healthy worker node.





Worker Node (minion node) - these will run the containers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1. kubelet
		- responsible for managing the containers on the node.
		- it interacts withe API Server to receive the instruction for creating, starting, stopping or monitoring continer.
	2. Container runtime (Docker / Containerd)
		- its a software that runs the container. 
		- Ex:- Docker, Containerd
	3. Kube-proxy
		- responsible for managing networking & load balancing.
		- it also manages the n/w connectivity & routing between services & containers.
